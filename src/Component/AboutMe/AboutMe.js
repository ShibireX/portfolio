                        <p>Music has always been a great passion of mine. Since the age of 14 
                            I have been producing music of my own together with a childhood friend,

                            and languages. As of today, I speak Swedish, English,

                        <p>I have always been around computer technology, but it wasnâ€™t until after I developed my first 
                            Java game that I realized how fun (and challenging) software development could be. 
                            Programming languages I build with include Swift, Python, JavaScript,
