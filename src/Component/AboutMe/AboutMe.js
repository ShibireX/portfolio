                        <p>Music has always been a great passion of mine. Since the age of 14 
                           I have been producing music of my own together with a childhood friend, 
                           under the alias <u>Rentz</u></p>

                        <p>I would describe myself as a cosmopolitan who loves to travel and learn about new cultures 
                            and languages. As of today, I speak Swedish, English, 
                            Spanish, Portuguese and some Korean</p>

                        <p>I have always been around computer technology, but it wasnâ€™t until after I developed my first 
                            Java game that I realized how fun (and challenging) software development could be. 
                            Programming languages I build with include Swift, Python, JavaScript, 
                            TypeScript, C# and more</p>

                        <p>My education consists of an engineering degree within computer science, with a masters in 
                            interactive media technology. My studies were conducted at KTH Royal Institute of 
                            Technology in Stockholm, Sweden</p>
